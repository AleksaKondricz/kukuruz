# Accordion

If you have a list to display, especially if its a list of questions and respective answers, then accordion is one of the best way to display it. `Accordion` makes it easy to understand for the user, reduces confusion and clutters. 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Accordion">
    <div>
       <Accordion/>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
