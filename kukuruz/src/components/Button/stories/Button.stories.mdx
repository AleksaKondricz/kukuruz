# Button

Buttons are one of the most important elements when it comes to giving the user the ability to interact with the web site/app. It can open modals, delete elements, save, get the user back or forward on the page. That's why when designing a web or mobile app it's of utmost importance to pay attention how our buttons look like, are they accessible and are they functional.

## Variants of Buttons

In order to create hierarchy, it's recommendable using different variants of buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button variants">
    <div>
      <Button variant="filled">Primary Button</Button>
      <Button variant="outline">Secondary Button</Button>
      <Button variant="subtle">Subtle Button</Button>
      <Button variant="gradient">Gradient Button</Button>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Sizes of Buttons

Buttons can come in different sizes as well, depending on where do we need to use the `Button` element. For example CTA Buttons are bigger than `buttons` in a form.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sizes ">
    <div>
      <Button variant="filled" size="sm">
        Small Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="filled" size="md">
        Medium Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="filled" size="lg">
        Large Button
      </Button>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Different states of Button

`Buttons` also can have different state. As a default state, we take the regular or normal state of a `button`. That's when a `button` has not been clicked or disabled, yet.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="States ">
    <h4>Different states of a primary button </h4>
    <div>
      <Button variant="filled">Normal Button</Button>
      <Button variant="filled" active>
        Active Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="filled" disabled>
        Disabled Button
      </Button>
    </div>
    <h4>Different states of a secondary button </h4>
    <div>
      <Button variant="outline">Normal Button</Button>
      <Button variant="outline" active>
        Active Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="outline" disabled>
        Disabled Button
      </Button>
    </div>
    <h4>Different states of a subtle button </h4>
    <div>
      <Button variant="subtle">Normal Button</Button>
      <Button variant="subtle" active>
        Active Button
      </Button>
      <Button variant="subtle" disabled>
        Disabled Button
      </Button>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
